# nvim-config
My config files to setup nvim with IDE like features
## Dependencies
- NeoVim `brew install neovim`
- Stow `brew install stow` https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/
## Getting started
- source the install script `source ./install.sh`. This will make `hvim` available in the current terminal session. With hvim you can work on the config stuff while your 'real' nvim configuration in `~/.config/nvim/` remains intact. Got the idea from this medium post, which is part of an awesome series on how to get going with NeoVim if you're a beginner. https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-for-beginners-init-lua-45ff91f741cb#f9a3
