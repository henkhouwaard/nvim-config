# nvim-config
My config files to setup nvim with IDE like features
## Dependencies
Install stow to make the install script work, `brew install stow`
## Getting started
- source the install script `source ./install.sh`. This will make `hvim` available in the current terminal session. With hvim you can work on the config stuff while your 'real' nvim configuration in `~/.config/nvim/` remains intact.
